# Bare_Min_Atmega328p
Custom PCB made for available in-house parts. Made just for testing the fab house and lab capabilities.

*Disclaimer*
This board has no defined purpose it was made for testing the ordering process and the lab assembly capabilities. 
Additionally, it was designed for the preexisting available components that were lying around the lab. Hence the part selection is suboptimal.
